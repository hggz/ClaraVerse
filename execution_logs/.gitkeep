# Execution Logs Directory

This directory contains the execution logs from workflow runs for easier analysis.

## Log Structure

Each workflow execution generates a log file with the format:
`{workflow_name}_{workflow_id}_{timestamp}.json`

The logs contain:
- Execution metadata (start time, duration, status)
- Node-by-node execution details
- Error information and stack traces
- Input/output data for each node
- Performance metrics
